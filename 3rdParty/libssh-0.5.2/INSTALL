# How to build from source

## Requirements

### Common requirements

In order to build libssh, you need to install several components:

- A C compiler
- [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) >= 2.6.0.
- [openssl](http://www.openssl.org) >= 0.9.8
or
- [gcrypt](http://www.gnu.org/directory/Security/libgcrypt.html) >= 1.4

optional:
- [libz](http://www.zlib.net) >= 1.2

Note that these version numbers are version we know works correctly. If you
build and run libssh successfully with an older version, please let us know.


## Building
First, you need to configure the compilation, using CMake. Go inside the
`build` dir. Create it if it doesn't exist.

GNU/Linux and MacOS X:

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
    make

### CMake standard options
Here is a list of the most interesting options provided out of the box by
CMake.

- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:     The type of build (can be Debug Release MinSizeRel
                        RelWithDebInfo)
- CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: The prefix to use when running make install (Default
                        to /usr/local on GNU/Linux and MacOS X)
- CMAKE_C_COMPILER:     The path to the C compiler
- CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:   The path to the C++ compiler

### CMake options defined for libssh

Options are defined in the following files:

- DefineOptions.cmake

They can be changed with the -D option:

`cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_LIBZ=OFF ..`

### Browsing/editing CMake options

In addition to passing options on the command line, you can browse and edit
CMake options using `cmakesetup` (Windows), `cmake-gui` or `ccmake` (GNU/Linux
and MacOS X).

- Go to the build dir
- On Windows: run `cmakesetup`
- On GNU/Linux and MacOS X: run `ccmake ..`

## Installing

If you want to install libssh after compilation run:

    make install

## Running

The libssh binary can be found in the `build/libssh` directory.
You can use `build/examples/samplessh` which is a sample client to
test libssh on UNIX.

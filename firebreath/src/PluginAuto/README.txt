Hey! We're glad you're using FireBreath. We hope you find it useful, and we hope you'll take
time to contribute back to the community.

Before we bore you with things you'll probably not read, THIS IS IMPORTANT:

The project FBTP_PluginAuto is made entirely of FireBreath framework files -- *you shouldn't ever
need to modify it* unless you are working on the FireBreath core.  The purpose of this project is
to put to use all of those variables set in the PluginConfig.cmake file in your main plugin project.
In other words, it's FireBreath files but with your plugin's config headers.

To get help:
http://www.firebreath.org houses our documentation and wiki! Please remember that the wiki can and
should be updated by anyone and everyone! Don't worry about being an expert; if you find something
useful, feel free to put it up. We'll monitor submissions and fix any inaccuracies.

To get more help:
http://www.firebreath.org/display/documentation/Live+Chat - We're quite often available on the IRC
room, which you can access from the web.

To contribute back:
If you have found FireBreath to be useful, please contribute! We accept three primary types of
contributions currently and ask that everyone support in at least one of these ways:

1. Update documentation on FireBreath.org - Most of the docs come from our users!

2. Find, Report, and/or even Fix bugs - If something annoys you, don't just ignore it.  Most major
   issues are fixed within 48 hours of being reported. See the issue tracker on the website or
   visit us in the IRC room.

3. Contribute money - Even $5 here and there helps to pay for our hosting costs and make us feel
   like someone appreciates our time. All funds are used on FireBreath related expenses, software,
   or hosting.

Thanks!
